# XLA Built-in Presets / Transforms v1.0.0


## Conventions

This document uses markdown. All the information about presets / transforms
is structured is a very specific ways, to allow easy parsing of this document
in the future. This can allow for creating common documentation in a different
format, for use by UI or other apps/projects/websites.

Also note how a lot of variables exposed are similar for presets described.
This is made so that transforms can be applied to as much presets as possible.
Transforms also have common elements, for those to have better support and
"special treatmeant" in UI.

Some common variables (constants) include: `MULTIPLIER`, `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`,
`SIZE`, `COLOR`, `COLORS`, `DEPTH`, `RADIUS`.
