# Format spec for .xla files

`.xla` files are a middle step for implementing [PewPewLive level](https://github.com/pewpewlive/ppl-utils) builder.
GUI can be used to generate those files, which are later compiled into an actual level:

Refer to `xla-spec-latest.md` for more info on how the latest version of .xla files store the level data.

## ToDo list

- [ ] Add `examples` with some levels, implemented via .xla
- [ ] Develop and document `xla-builtin.md` doc, describing built-in presets/transforms/patches.
